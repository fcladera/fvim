# fvim

A blazing fast vim configuration targeted towards Neovim. Since Dec 2022, I
decided to switch to [nvim-basic-ide](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide) 
as the source for my configuration.  This configuration is light enough, with
sane defaults, and easy to extend. Moreover, it tracks upstream changes in
Neovim quite well.

The Neovim plugin ecosystem has became complex enough that it is worth to leverage
the work of the community for your own config!
