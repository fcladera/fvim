# fvim

This is my vim distribution. It is inspired in [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus),
[spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) and [tpope's dotfiles](https://github.com/tpope/tpope).
 However, I try to keep things simple and focus on speed.

A piece of advice: write your **own** .vimrc file. Fork this repository
and tune it, it provides a good starting point!

**This distribution is not intended to work in Windows!**
